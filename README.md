A simulation of an e-commerce site developed together with my companions at Aulab.it.
Inside you can find:
-User registration and login via Laravel fortify;
-The 4 CRUD operations for managing user ads;
-The possibility of a user becoming an ad reviewer by automatically sending emails to the site admin, the user is able to accept or refuse ads;
-The reviewer panel where various tools(jobs) have been implemented such as image cropping, adding watermarks and Google Vision AI to obtain automatic face recognition, tags and labels on images based on what they represent;
